# AWS Inventory

Python script to scan an AWS environment and build an inventory of resources, along with their details and how they are related to each other.

**Note**: I used to manage and develop something similar for one of my previous employers. That did quite a lot more than this, rather basic, data extraction and manipulation, building an internal-only website using HTML toolkits such as Bootstrap and DataTables. I have purposefully not put that part in since that is and should be their proprietary code.

## Architecture

The script is broken down into four modules, one for each of the four core services AWS provides: EC2, VPC, S3, and IAM. The main script, `main.py`, calls these four modules. The findings are put as json files in a separate folder/directory called `data`.

## Sample run

```
thatvirdiguy@[hostname]:~/AWS-Inventory$ python3 main.py
Collecting EC2 info...
Done building EC2 info...
Collecting VPC info...
Done building VPC info...
Collecting S3 info...
Done building S3 info...
Collecting IAM info...
Done building IAM info...
thatvirdiguy@[hostname]:~/AWS-Inventory$
```
